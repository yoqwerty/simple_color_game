<h4> Objecive of the game </h4>
<p>In your version of Mastermind, the computer will be the codemaker and one player will be the codebreaker. The computer picks a sequence of 4 pegs, each one being one of any of size colors.

The objective of the game is to guess the exact positions of the colors in the computer's sequence in as few guesses as possible. After each guess, the computer gives you a score of exact and partial matches.

<h4>Scoring</h4>
<p>For each of the pegs in your guess that is the correct color and in the correct position, the computer will give you one small black peg to the right of that move. If you score 4 small black pegs on a guess, you have guessed the secret sequence.

For each of the pegs in your guess that is a correct color in an incorrect position, the computer will give you one small white peg to the right of that move. Together, there will be no more than four small black and white pegs for each move.

If none of the pegs in your guess is of a correct color, you will see no small pegs to the right of that move</p>
